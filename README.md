# Crypto Seminar, Winter 2022 

This course is officially "CMSC 33251-1: Topics in Computer Security". It is
a PhD-level seminar aimed at covering a few research topics in preparation for
dong research in those areas.

This quarter the seminar is about *obliviously accessing data*. We'll take a
broad look at research on how to efficiently access data at untrusted server
while preserving as much privacy as possible. 

Two topics of initial focus will be *private information retrieval (PIR)* and
*oblivious RAM (ORAM)*. I will give some background lectures on both of these
topics, starting with some older papers. Then we'll move on to more recent
papers together, in search of open problems. We can investigate both applied
and theoretical directions, depending on the group's interests.

**Logistics**: 

- Meetings are Mon-Weds at 1:30-2:50pm in Ryerson 277 (this location may change
  to a conference room after the first meeting). 

- This GitHub repo will serve as our course website.

- This course will not count as an elective. If you need elective credit,
  please speak with me.

**Expected participation**: There are two main expectations. First,
participants in the seminar should attend all 18 meetings, attempt associated
readings beforehand, and be generally prepared with questions.  Second,
participants will be asked to do a close read on one topic and lead (or
co-lead) at least one meeting on that topic.
